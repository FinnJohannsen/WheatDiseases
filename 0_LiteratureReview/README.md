**Summary of Each Work**:

- **Source 1**: Leaf and spike wheat disease detection & classification using an improved deep convolutional architecture

  - **(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914821001313#fig3)()**
  - **Classify 9 wheat diseases from the LWDCD2020 dataset**:
  - **CNN (21 Layers) with 2x2 maxpooling**:
  - **The work achieved a 97.88% accuracy on the 10 classes(9 diseases +1 healthy class)**:
  - **We are doing the same thing for a Dataset with 14 different diseases instead of 9**:
