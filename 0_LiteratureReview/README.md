Approaches or solutions that have been tried before on similar projects.

**Summary of Each Work**:

- **Source 1**: Leaf and spike wheat disease detection & classification using an improved deep convolutional architecture

  - **https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914821001313**
  - **Objective**: **Classify 9 wheat diseases from the LWDCD2020 dataset**
  - **Methods**: **CNN (21 Layers) with 2x2 maxpooling**
  - **Outcomes**: **The work achieved a 97.88% accuracy on the 10 classes(9 diseases +1 healthy class)**
  - **Relation to the Project**: **We are doing the same thing for a Dataset with 14 different diseases instead of 9**

- **Source 2**: A deep learning based approach for automated plant disease classification using vision transformer

  - **https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15163-0**
  - **Objective**: **Studying lightweight vision transformer for plant disease classification**
  - **Methods**: **Comparing CNN and transformer blocks as well as combination**
  - **Outcomes**: **ViT had a higher accuracy compared to other tested models, but was smaller and faster than big state of the art models**
  - **Relation to the Project**: **We might try a transformer based architecture**

- **Source 3**: Using Deep Learning for Image-Based Plant Disease Detection

  - **https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.01419/full**
  - **Objective**: **train exisitng models to detect diseases on different plants**
  - **Methods**: **vary different architectures, training mechanisms, dataset types and train-test-distributions**
  - **Outcomes**: **the parameters made a huge impacton the accuracy**
  - **Relation to the Project**: **Try out different parameters and setups for our models**
